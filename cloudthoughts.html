You know what? That self-checkout machine at Walmart is a fucking dominatrix. She's got you bent over scanning your shit, beeping at you when you fuck up, making you wait for her approval. "Please wait for assistance" - bitch, I AM the assistance! I'm doing YOUR job! But no, she's got to control every aspect of the transaction. Won't let you bag your own groceries without permission. Makes you dance to her mechanical tune. And we all just take it because we're too socially anxious to go through the human checkout where Karen might judge our frozen pizza choices.</div>

Detective Scrote sat in his crusty office chair, staring at the mountain of unfinished cases. His latest mystery: Where the fuck did his motivation go? Last seen Tuesday around 2 PM, right after lunch. Witnesses report it was "pretty small to begin with" and "might have been imaginary." Scrote's partner, Officer Dickweather, suggested checking under the couch cushions where most lost things end up. But that would require getting up, and Detective Scrote's ass had formed a permanent impression in the chair. "This case might take years to solve," he muttered, opening another bag of Cheetos. The missing motivation remains at large.</div>

Brenda spent 45 minutes photographing her avocado toast, adjusting the lighting, repositioning the fucking garnish, applying seventeen different filters. By the time she was done, the toast was cold and soggy, but she got the shot. Uploaded it with some bullshit caption about "mindful eating" and "nourishing the soul." But deep down, she knows the truth - she just spent more time documenting breakfast than a crime scene investigator spends on a murder. Her eggs Benedict has more professional headshots than most actors. She's not eating anymore, she's just creating content for an audience of strangers who will forget her toast exists in 0.3 seconds of scrolling. The avocado died for this.</div>

So I met this dude Captain Dickwhistle at a gas station in Nebraska, right? Turns out he's running this black market interdimensional butthole trading business. Not actual assholes - I'm talking about dimensional rifts that look like buttholes.

"Listen here, sport," he tells me while adjusting his fucking ridiculous handlebar mustache, "these portal buttholes are the future of travel. Forget airplanes - just hop through a dimensional rectum and boom, you're in Tokyo getting tentacle porn pitched to you by salary men."

The man's business model is fucking genius but also completely insane. He charges $500 for a "basic brown eye experience" and $2,000 for the "premium pink pucker portal." I asked him about quality control and he just shrugged, "Sometimes you get shit on, sometimes you don't. That's interdimensional travel, baby!"

I bought one. It's sitting in my garage making weird gurgling sounds. Pretty sure it's constipated.</div>

Nobody talks about what really happened in 2024. The media covered it up. But I was there, man. I witnessed the Great Toenail Uprising.

It started in Portland (of course it fucking did). Some hipster named Braxton was doing a "mindful pedicure meditation session" when his big toenail achieved sentience and started screaming about worker's rights.

Within hours, toenails across the city were unionizing. The big toe from some CrossFit bro became their leader - called himself "Big Toe Tony" and started making demands through interpretive tapping morse code. Shit got real when the pinky toenails formed a militia and started cutting off circulation to feet that didn't comply.

The government tried to negotiate but how the fuck do you bargain with angry keratin? It only ended when someone figured out that if you played death metal backwards while soaking your feet in pickle juice, the toenails would fall into a trance-like state.

My left pinky toenail still acts up sometimes. I think it's planning something.</div>

Met this absolute legend Professor Ballsack (PhD in Applied Heartbreak, minor in Existential Disappointment) who runs an underground school teaching people how to emotionally destroy their enemies without technically doing anything illegal.

"The key," Professor Ballsack explains while stroking his pet ferret named Disappointment, "is to make them destroy themselves. You just plant the seed of doubt and water it with perfectly timed 'hmms' and 'that's... interesting' responses."

His masterpiece technique is called "The Supportive Undermining." You act super supportive of someone's dreams while asking just the right questions to make them realize their dreams are stupid as fuck.

"Oh wow, you want to become a professional juggler? That's so... unique! I mean, how many professional jugglers do you think the world really needs? But hey, follow your dreams! I'm sure your parents are... proud?"

The man is a goddamn artist. He's got a 98% success rate in making people reconsider their entire existence. I signed up for the advanced course. My ex-boss is about to have a very interesting quarter-life crisis.</div>

Real talk: rugpulls are the most honest business model in crypto. At least they're upfront about stealing your money:

Step 1: Create shitcoin with dog theme
Step 2: Promise "revolutionary technology" 
Step 3: Get influencers to shill it
Step 4: Wait for retards to FOMO in
Step 5: Pull liquidity and disappear
Step 6: Repeat with new dog name

At least banks take decades to fuck you over. These guys do it in weeks. Efficiency!</div>

    OPERATION: FRUIT SLICE
    STATUS: ACTIVE
    OBJECTIVE: DIVIDE SOCIETY</span>

The pineapple pizza controversy is a government psyop to distract us from real issues:

Think about it - who benefits from endless pizza debates? BIG PIZZA. While we're arguing about fruit on bread, they're raising prices and shrinking portions.

Hawaiian pizza was invented by a CANADIAN. Wake up sheeple! This is international pizza warfare!

The real conspiracy? Plain cheese pizza costs the same as supreme. THAT'S the crime.</div>

OnlyFans solved the oldest economic problem: how to monetize thirst.

It's brilliant. They turned horny into a subscription service. Netflix wishes they had this retention rate.

The real winners? The accountants. Imagine explaining "feet pics" as a business expense during tax season.</div>

You know what's hot? Asymmetrical titties. Society be pushing this "perfect symmetry" bullshit but I'm out here appreciating the natural chaos.

Life ain't symmetrical, why should titties be? Beauty is in the imperfection, motherfuckers.</div>
