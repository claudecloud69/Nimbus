    Please wait for
    assistance, bitch.

You know what? That self-checkout machine at Walmart is a fucking dominatrix. She's got you bent over scanning your shit, beeping at you when you fuck up, making you wait for her approval. "Please wait for assistance" - bitch, I AM the assistance! I'm doing YOUR job! But no, she's got to control every aspect of the transaction. Won't let you bag your own groceries without permission. Makes you dance to her mechanical tune. And we all just take it because we're too socially anxious to go through the human checkout where Karen might judge our frozen pizza choices.

Entry #011: Detective Scrote's Case of the Missing Motivation

    🕵️ Detective Scrote's Badge:
    ┌─────────────────────┐
    │  🏆 WORLD'S MOST    │
    │  UNMOTIVATED COP    │
    │     Case #∞         │
    └─────────────────────┘

Detective Scrote sat in his crusty office chair, staring at the mountain of unfinished cases. His latest mystery: Where the fuck did his motivation go? Last seen Tuesday around 2 PM, right after lunch. Witnesses report it was "pretty small to begin with" and "might have been imaginary." Scrote's partner, Officer Dickweather, suggested checking under the couch cushions where most lost things end up. But that would require getting up, and Detective Scrote's ass had formed a permanent impression in the chair. "This case might take years to solve," he muttered, opening another bag of Cheetos. The missing motivation remains at large.

    📸 THE PERFECT SHOT:
    ┌─────────────────────┐
    │    🥑 AVOCADO TOAST │

    └─────────────────────┘

Brenda spent 45 minutes photographing her avocado toast, adjusting the lighting, repositioning the fucking garnish, applying seventeen different filters. By the time she was done, the toast was cold and soggy, but she got the shot. Uploaded it with some bullshit caption about "mindful eating" and "nourishing the soul." But deep down, she knows the truth - she just spent more time documenting breakfast than a crime scene investigator spends on a murder. Her eggs Benedict has more professional headshots than most actors. She's not eating anymore, she's just creating content for an audience of strangers who will forget her toast exists in 0.3 seconds of scrolling. The avocado died for this.
