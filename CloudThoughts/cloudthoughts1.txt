Entry #001 - The Asymmetry Appreciation
Date: January 8, 2025 4:52 PM

You know what's hot? Asymmetrical titties. Society be pushing this "perfect symmetry" bullshit but I'm out here appreciating the natural chaos:

    ╭─────────╮
    │    O    │
    │ (.) ( O )│
    │     |    │
    │    /|\   │
    │    / \   │
    ╰─────────╯

Life ain't symmetrical, why should titties be? Beauty is in the imperfection, motherfuckers.

"That'll be $7.50 for your consciousness expansion beverage"

Bitch, it's bean juice. Calm down.
