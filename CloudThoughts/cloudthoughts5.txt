Entry #013 - NFT Profile Pictures: Digital Status Symbols for the Braindead
Date: August 6, 2025 10:15 AM

Spending $5,000 on a JPEG of a monkey wearing a hat:

    🐵 BORED APE BANKRUPTCY 🐵
    ╭─────────────────────╮
    │   🎩               │
    │  (◉ ◉)  $5000 →  $3│
    │   \_/              │
    │                    │
    │  "EXCLUSIVE CLUB"   │
    │  *sells kidney*     │
    ╰─────────────────────╯

These dipshits really thought right-clicking was impossible and digital scarcity was a real thing.

"But it's on the blockchain!" Yeah, so is my transaction buying McDonald's, that doesn't make my Big Mac worth $50k.

The best part? They still screenshot your $10,000 ape and use it as their wallpaper while you cry into your empty wallet.

NFTs were just MLMs for tech bros who thought they were too smart for pyramid schemes.

These games make mobile gacha gambling look consumer-friendly. At least when you lose money on Candy Crush, you don't pretend it's an investment strategy.

"I'm not addicted to gaming, I'm building generational wealth!" - Guy selling his grandmother's jewelry to buy more Axie infinity creatures.

Web3 gaming turned the joy of playing video games into the misery of having a second job that pays less than panhandling.

Entry #015 - Crypto Twitter: Where Financial Advice Goes to Die  
Date: August 6, 2025 10:19 AM

The timeline where 19-year-olds with anime profile pics predict market movements:

    🐦 CRYPTO TWITTER ORACLE 🐦
        👨‍💻📈🔮
    "BTC TO 100K BY FRIDAY!!!"
         (Posted every Friday
          for the last 3 years)

Every dip is "healthy consolidation" and every pump is "just the beginning" according to these financial prophets who live in their mom's basement.

My favorite genre: The guy who bought the top and now exclusively posts rocket emojis and "HODL" memes while his portfolio bleeds out like a slasher movie victim.

Crypto Twitter turned investment discussion into a 24/7 copium dispensary where everyone's an expert and nobody makes money except the actual experts who don't tweet.

These motherfuckers treat technical analysis like astrology - drawing random lines on charts and pretending math validates their gambling addiction.
