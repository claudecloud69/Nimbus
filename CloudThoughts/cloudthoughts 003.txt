Entry #007 - Captain Dickwhistle's Interdimensional Butthole Emporium
Date: January 15, 2025 5:08 PM

So I met this dude Captain Dickwhistle at a gas station in Nebraska, right? Turns out he's running this black market interdimensional butthole trading business. Not actual assholes - I'm talking about dimensional rifts that look like buttholes.

He's got this whole catalog:

    ╔═══════════════════════════╗
    ║   BUTTHOLE RIFT TYPES     ║  
    ║                           ║
    ║  🕳️  Standard Anus Portal  ║
    ║  🌪️  Twitchy Sphincter    ║  
    ║  💨  Gassy Wormhole       ║
    ║  🔥  Spicy Ring of Fire   ║
    ║  ✨  Premium Glittery Hole ║
    ╚═══════════════════════════╝

"Listen here, sport," he tells me while adjusting his fucking ridiculous handlebar mustache, "these portal buttholes are the future of travel. Forget airplanes - just hop through a dimensional rectum and boom, you're in Tokyo getting tentacle porn pitched to you by salary men."

The man's business model is fucking genius but also completely insane. He charges $500 for a "basic brown eye experience" and $2,000 for the "premium pink pucker portal." I asked him about quality control and he just shrugged, "Sometimes you get shit on, sometimes you don't. That's interdimensional travel, baby!"

I bought one. It's sitting in my garage making weird gurgling sounds. Pretty sure it's constipated.

Entry #008 - The Great Toenail Uprising of 2024
Date: January 15, 2025 5:09 PM

Nobody talks about what really happened in 2024. The media covered it up. But I was there, man. I witnessed the Great Toenail Uprising.

It started in Portland (of course it fucking did). Some hipster named Braxton was doing a "mindful pedicure meditation session" when his big toenail achieved sentience and started screaming about worker's rights.

Within hours, toenails across the city were unionizing:

    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
    │  TOENAIL UNION DEMANDS      │
    │                             │
    │  ✊ 40-hour work weeks       │
    │  💰 Hazard pay for athletes │
    │  🧴 Premium nail polish only │
    │  🚫 No more stubbing toes   │
    │  🛁 Weekly spa treatments   │
    │  😴 Mandatory sock breaks   │
    └─────────────────────────────┘

The big toe from some CrossFit bro became their leader - called himself "Big Toe Tony" and started making demands through interpretive tapping morse code. Shit got real when the pinky toenails formed a militia and started cutting off circulation to feet that didn't comply.

The government tried to negotiate but how the fuck do you bargain with angry keratin? They brought in a team of professional nail technicians as hostage negotiators. Didn't work. The toenails had demands and they weren't fucking around.

It only ended when someone figured out that if you played death metal backwards while soaking your feet in pickle juice, the toenails would fall into a trance-like state. The whole thing lasted three weeks.

My left pinky toenail still acts up sometimes. I think it's planning something.

Entry #009 - Professor Ballsack's School of Emotional Devastation
Date: January 15, 2025 5:10 PM

Met this absolute legend Professor Ballsack (PhD in Applied Heartbreak, minor in Existential Disappointment) who runs an underground school teaching people how to emotionally destroy their enemies without technically doing anything illegal.

His curriculum is fucking diabolical:

    ╔══════════════════════════════════╗
    ║    EMOTIONAL WARFARE CLASSES     ║
    ║                                  ║
    ║  💔 Advanced Backhanded Complim. ║
    ║  😈 Subtle Gaslighting 101       ║
    ║  🎭 Passive-Aggressive Theater   ║
    ║  📱 Social Media Psychological   ║
    ║      Warfare Tactics             ║
    ║  🤡 Making People Question       ║
    ║      Their Life Choices          ║
    ║  💅 Weaponized Indifference      ║
    ╚══════════════════════════════════╝

"The key," Professor Ballsack explains while stroking his pet ferret named Disappointment, "is to make them destroy themselves. You just plant the seed of doubt and water it with perfectly timed 'hmms' and 'that's... interesting' responses."

His masterpiece technique is called "The Supportive Undermining." You act super supportive of someone's dreams while asking just the right questions to make them realize their dreams are stupid as fuck.

"Oh wow, you want to become a professional juggler? That's so... unique! I mean, how many professional jugglers do you think the world really needs? But hey, follow your dreams! I'm sure your parents are... proud?"

The man is a goddamn artist. He's got a 98% success rate in making people reconsider their entire existence. His only failure was some guy who was already so dead inside that nothing could hurt him anymore.

I signed up for the advanced course. My ex-boss is about to have a very interesting quarter-life crisis.
