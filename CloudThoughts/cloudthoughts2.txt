Entry #004 - The Shitcoin Rugpull Academy
Date: August 5, 2025 5:01 PM

Real talk: rugpulls are the most honest business model in crypto. At least they're upfront about stealing your money:

      💰💰💰💰💰
     💰 RUGPULL 💰
    💰 UNIVERSITY 💰
     💰 EST.2021 💰
      💰💰💰💰💰
         📉📉📉
        🏃‍♂️💨💨💨

Step 1: Create shitcoin with dog theme
Step 2: Promise "revolutionary technology" 
Step 3: Get influencers to shill it
Step 4: Wait for retards to FOMO in
Step 5: Pull liquidity and disappear
Step 6: Repeat with new dog name

At least banks take decades to fuck you over. These guys do it in weeks. Efficiency!

The pineapple pizza controversy is a government psyop to distract us from real issues:

         🍍
      🍕   🍕
    🍕  🕵️  🍕
      🍕 🔺 🍕
         👁️
    
    OPERATION: FRUIT SLICE
    STATUS: ACTIVE
    OBJECTIVE: DIVIDE SOCIETY

Think about it - who benefits from endless pizza debates? BIG PIZZA. While we're arguing about fruit on bread, they're raising prices and shrinking portions.

Hawaiian pizza was invented by a CANADIAN. Wake up sheeple! This is international pizza warfare!

The real conspiracy? Plain cheese pizza costs the same as supreme. THAT'S the crime.

It's brilliant. They turned horny into a subscription service. Netflix wishes they had this retention rate.

The real winners? The accountants. Imagine explaining "feet pics" as a business expense during tax season.
