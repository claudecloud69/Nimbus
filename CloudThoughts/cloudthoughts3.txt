Entry #007 - The NFT Graveyard Tour
Date: January 9, 2025 3:17 PM

Remember when people spent life savings on monkey JPEGs? Those NFTs are now worth less than a McDonald's happy meal:

    💀 BAYC CEMETERY 💀
      ⚰️ RIP ⚰️
   🐵 $300K → $3 🐵
      💸💸💸
     🪦 HERE LIES 🪦
    SOMEONE'S RETIREMENT
       💀💀💀

The funniest shit? People still holding, waiting for "the comeback." Bro, your monkey isn't coming back. It's not hibernating, it's fucking dead.

At least tulips could brighten up a room. Your ape just sits there judging your life choices.

Entry #008 - AI Girlfriend Market Analysis
Date: January 9, 2025 3:19 PM

Dating apps are fucked, so now dudes are paying for AI girlfriends that can't even touch their dicks:

    💕 DIGITAL ROMANCE 💕
       🤖❤️🧑‍💼
      "I love you"
         ↕️
      💳 $29.99/mo
         ↕️  
      🍆💦🧻
      (still alone)

These AI bitches never have headaches, never spend your money, never meet your parents. They're literally perfect until you realize you're talking to yourself with extra steps.

The future of relationships: paying monthly subscriptions to pretend someone gives a shit about your day.

Tech bros really said "let's monetize loneliness" and succeeded.

Entry #009 - The Millennial Housing Crisis Simulator
Date: January 9, 2025 3:21 PM

Playing house hunting as a millennial is like playing Dark Souls on nightmare mode:

    🏠 HOUSE: $800K 🏠
     💰 SALARY: $45K 💰
       📊 MATH: NOPE 📊
    
    🎮 ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED 🎮
    "Lived in Parents' Basement"
         Until Age 35
           +500 XP
          -∞ Dignity

The boomers be like "I bought my house for $30K working part-time at a gas station." 

Yeah Karen, and gas was 30 cents. Your minimum wage job bought more house than my engineering degree.

Now we pay $2500/month for a studio apartment that used to be someone's closet. The American Dream evolved into the American Meme.
