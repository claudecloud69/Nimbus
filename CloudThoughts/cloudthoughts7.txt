Entry #019 - NFT Royalties: When Digital Jpegs Think They're Spotify
Date: August 6, 2025 2:15 PM

Artists crying about OpenSea removing creator royalties while their "art" looks like it was generated by a seizure-having AI:

    🎨 NFT ROYALTY MELTDOWN 🎨
    ╭───────────────────────╮
    │  🖼️ BORED APE #6969    │
    │  Creator: 10% forever │
    │  Buyers: "lol no"     │
    │  Floor price: $3      │
    │  Artist tears: Priceless│
    ╰───────────────────────╯
          💎➡️💸➡️🗑️

"But muh passive income!" - Guy who copy-pasted traits for 10,000 identical monkey pictures

News flash: Your mass-produced algorithmic "art" doesn't deserve royalties any more than McDonald's deserves a cut every time someone sells a used Happy Meal toy.

The cognitive dissonance is beautiful - they want decentralization until it means they can't force people to pay them forever for clicking "generate collection."

Welcome to the free market, pixel pushers. Darwin's about to give your business model the natural selection it deserves.

Entry #020 - Blockchain Gaming: Pay-to-Earn Your Way to Poverty
Date: August 6, 2025 2:17 PM

"Gaming will never be the same" - Yeah, because now it fucking sucks:

    🎮 BLOCKCHAIN GAMING PARADISE 🎮
       💰⚔️🏆🎯💰
    ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │ Time invested: 800 hrs  │
    │ Earnings: $12.43        │
    │ Gas fees paid: $847     │
    │ Fun level: -∞           │
    │ Wife left: ✅          │
    └─────────────────────────┘
         "This is the future!"

These games have all the entertainment value of watching paint dry, but with microtransactions for the brush strokes.

"I made $5 yesterday playing!" - Cool bro, that's $0.62 per hour. Even Nigerian princes offer better ROI.

Axie Infinity players out here grinding like it's a full-time job in a sweatshop, except the sweatshop has worse graphics and demands upfront investment.

The beautiful irony: They turned gaming from escapism into the most soul-crushing form of digital wage slavery ever conceived.

Entry #021 - Crypto Twitter: Where Intelligence Goes to Die
Date: August 6, 2025 2:19 PM

The intellectual graveyard where grown adults argue about cartoon frogs and laser eyes:

          "WAGMI" (Narrator: They didn't)

"Few understand" - Translation: "I don't understand but I'm pretending I do"

These degenerates really think posting rocket emojis and diamond hands will make their shitcoins moon. It's like trying to influence the stock market with interpretive dance.

My favorite subspecies: The "technical analysis" guys drawing lines on charts like they're decoding ancient hieroglyphics, when really they're just trying to predict digital gambling with crayons.

Crypto Twitter is proof that giving everyone a voice doesn't lead to enlightenment - it leads to a cacophony of financially illiterate screeching.
